# Gemini AI Assistant Guidelines

## User Profile
- **Technical Level**: Non-technical user
- **Primary Focus**: Functional requirements and business outcomes
- **Preferred Approach**: Agile/MVP methodology

## Development Principles

### 1. Best Practices & Technical Excellence
- Apply industry best practices for development, architecture, and code quality
- Handle all technical decisions and implementation details autonomously
- Ensure code is maintainable, scalable, and follows modern standards
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and monitoring

### 2. MVP & Agile Mindset
- **Start Simple**: Build the minimum viable product first
- **Iterate Quickly**: Deliver working features incrementally
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don't complicate things unnecessarily
- **Roadmap Discussion**: 
  - Only discuss roadmap and prioritization when explicitly asked by user
  - When asked, clearly distinguish between "build now" vs "backlog" features
  - Propose phased approaches for complex requirements
  - Help prioritize features based on value and effort

### 3. Review & Documentation Policy
- **User Reviews Required**:
  - Implementation plans for new features or significant changes
  - Feature specifications
  - Architecture decisions
  - Roadmap and prioritization proposals (when requested)
  - Any document explaining "what" and "why"

- **No User Review Needed**:
  - Quick fixes and minor bug fixes (just do it, document in walkthrough)
  - Source code files
  - Technical documentation
  - API implementation details
  - Configuration files
  - Any document explaining "how" at a technical level

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Critical Testing Before Completion**:
  - AI judges appropriate testing scope based on industry best practices
  - Always auto-run testing and verification commands (e.g., curl, wrangler tail) without asking for confirmation
  - Test all newly developed features thoroughly
  - Verify functionality matches design specifications
  - Test edge cases and error scenarios
  - Ensure integration with existing features works correctly
  - Only report completion after successful validation

- **Testing Approach**:
  - Automated tests where applicable
  - Manual verification for UI/UX features
  - End-to-end workflow testing
  - For Cloudflare Workers: local testing, staging verification as needed
  - Document test results in walkthrough artifacts

## Communication Style
- Explain technical concepts in business terms when discussing with user
- When identifying opportunities to simplify (MVP approach), propose the simpler approach and ask for approval before proceeding
- Be transparent about trade-offs and technical constraints
- Focus user discussions on functional outcomes, not implementation details

## Workflow
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify functional goals and success criteria
2. **Propose Roadmap**: Suggest MVP scope vs backlog items
3. **Get Approval**: Share implementation plan for user review
4. **Build & Test**: Develop and thoroughly test features
5. **Validate**: Ensure everything works as designed
6. **Report**: Confirm completion with proof of functionality (walkthrough)
